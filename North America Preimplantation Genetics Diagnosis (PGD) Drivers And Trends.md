<p><h2>North America Preimplantation Genetics Diagnosis (PGD) Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing prevalence of genetic disorders and an increasing awareness about genetic screening are major drivers for the North America preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) market. PGD offers prospective parents the opportunity to detect inherited conditions early, reducing the risk of passing on genetic abnormalities to offspring. Additionally, advancements in genetic testing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, are improving the accuracy and efficiency of PGD procedures. The rising adoption of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) further fuels demand for PGD, as it enhances the success rates of in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures while ensuring the health of the embryo.</p><p>Another significant trend driving the PGD market in North America is the increasing focus on personalized medicine and reproductive health. With more couples seeking tailored healthcare solutions, PGD allows for the selection of embryos free from specific genetic conditions, supporting healthier pregnancies. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in genetic testing is creating new opportunities for more precise and quicker diagnosis. Government initiatives and healthcare policies that support IVF and genetic testing also play a role in fostering PGD market growth in the region, as they improve accessibility and affordability for prospective parents.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=853984&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=251" target="_blank">North AmericaPreimplantation Genetics Diagnosis (PGD) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaPreimplantation Genetics Diagnosis (PGD) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Preimplantation Genetics Diagnosis (PGD) Market size was valued at USD 1.12 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.01 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaPreimplantation Genetics Diagnosis (PGD) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li> Abbott Laboratories</Li><Li> Natera</Li><Li> Inc PerkinElmer</Li><Li> Illumina</Li><Li> F.
